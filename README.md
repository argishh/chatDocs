# ChatDocs - RAG based Chat Assistant

ChatDocs is an intelligent document chat system that allows users to upload documents and interact with them through natural language queries. The system uses RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to provide accurate, context-aware responses based on the uploaded documents.

    <summary><b>‚ùî FAQs</b><br></summary>

###  **How does ChatDocs work?** 
*ChatDocs uses RAG to generate responses based on the uploaded documents. It first indexes and embeds the documents using ChromaDB and then uses the LangChain pipeline to process the queries and generate responses.*

### **What file formats are supported?**
*ChatDocs currently supports PDF, DOCX, and TXT file formats. You can upload documents in any of these formats and interact with them using natural language queries.*

### **Can I use my own GPT model?**
*Yes, you can use your own GPT model by setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key. ChatDocs currently supports OpenAI's GPT-3 model, but you can easily switch to other models by changing the API key.*

### **Is my data secure?**
*Yes, your data is secure with ChatDocs. The documents are stored securely in the ChromaDB vectorstore, and the API endpoints are protected against common vulnerabilities. The system uses session-based authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access the data.*

### **What is RAG?**
*RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a transformer-based model that combines the power of retrieval-based and generative models. It uses a retriever to find relevant documents and a generator to produce responses based on the retrieved context.*
